Debugging innovations</A>
</H2>
We implemented a lot of strategies, and understanding their
behavior was not always easy. What helped us a lot was to
think about how differently a new strategy might perform
from a standard strategy. The base strategies such as LRU,
LFU and FIFO were useful for comparison and testing. These
are probably the oldest  as well as the
most used portions of our code and were 
 particularly useful for debugging newer strategies.

<P>
As an example, we describe the debugging of some
strategies. We implemented some multilevel queuing
strategies. These used LRU policy between queues, and LFU
within a particular queue. Another policy did the reverse,
maintaining LFU between queues and LRU within them. Many
problems were caught by proper use of the boundary cases
here. Observe that if the queue size is one, the policy
becomes pure LRU in one case and pure LFU in the
other. Similarly, if there is only one queue, then the
policies become equivalent to pure LFU and pure LRU
respectively.

<P>
We also created random access traces to test our strategies. We 
generated of the order of <IMG

 SRC="img2.png"
 ALT="$10^4$"> test cases for debugging 
purposes. In this regard, it was found useful to have artificial values
of cache parameters (e.g. a 8 byte cache with line size 1) to help us
understand what was going on. This was very useful for debugging.
We used shell scripts heavily to carry out the extensive testing.
