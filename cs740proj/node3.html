Pitfalls and Workarounds</A>
</H2>
We realized that we need to use real-life data to test our
cache behavior, not just standard benchmarks. For this purpose, 
we obtained
data access traces for some C++ and Java programs
representing classic programming problems. These are smaller
than the well-recognized SPEC benchmarks, but still show
some interesting behavior. We also looked at the Mediabench
programs to see what special characteristics a multimedia
application possesses.

<P>
A big problem for us was that the ATOM-instrumented code
runs very slowly. This is logical since the original programs
themselves are quite time-consuming. Through 
our instrumentation routines, we have further increased the 
 time required for every memory access. After some thought,
we realized that we did not really need to execute the
entire program every time we modified our cache policy. 
What was important for us was the trace of
the data access. Given this, a driver could apply the cache
replacement strategies in essentially a platform-independent
way, 
to execute our implementation. 
Collecting the  program traces was a non-trivial exercise, 
mostly because large programs required huge amounts of storage. 
For example, one of 
the SPEC benchmarks (the JPEG program) generated about 8 billion 
addresses. 
Thus in some cases, it was better to run
the program, albeit slowly, than to use a stored trace. 
Thus there was a trade-off
between time and disk-space. The trace method was used for the smaller
programs and for debugging purposes.
