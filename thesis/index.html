<h4>Abstract</h4>

<p>
Dynamic Web applications are becoming increasingly popular and represent the
future landscape of Web applications. Currently there is no effective way to
increase the scalability of such applications without significant investment
in infrastructure and in-house management capability.  In this thesis we
develop the foundations of a Database Scalability Service (DBSS) that is able
to offer scalability as a plug-in subscription service to dynamic Web
applications. A DBSS works by caching application's data and answering queries
on their behalf. We present the overall architecture of a DBSS, and address
two key issues in designing a DBSS: (1) the privacy concerns of applications
in allowing the DBSS to cache their data, and (2) the performance concerns due
to the high latency applications face in accessing their data. There is an
important privacy-scalability tradeoff in the DBSS setting, which requires
careful consideration. To help applications manage this tradeoff, we propose:
(1) a scalability-conscious security design methodology that achieves good
scalability while adhering to a security policy, and (2) invalidation clues, a
general technique that enables applications to balance their privacy and
scalability needs at a fine granularity. To address the performance concerns,
we present two transformations that reduce the latency applications face in
accessing their data.  Our experiments with three realistic benchmark
applications we study confirm the effectiveness of our methods.
