<h4>Abstract</h4>

<p>Providers of dynamic Web applications are currently unable to
accommodate heavy usage without significant investment in
infrastructure and in-house management capability. Our goal is to
develop technology to enable a third party to offer scalability as a
subscription service with ``per-click'' pricing to application
providers.  To this end we have developed a prototype proxy caching
system able to scale delivery of dynamic Web content to a large number
of users.  In this paper we report initial positive results obtained
from our prototype that point to the feasibility of our goal. We also
report the shortcomings of our current prototype, the chief one being the
lack of a scalable method of managing data consistency. We then
present our initial work on a novel approach to scalable consistency
management. Our approach is based on a fully distributed mechanism
that does not require content providers to assist in managing the
consistency of remotely cached data. Finally, we describe our ongoing
efforts to characterize the inherent tradeoff between scalability and
data secrecy, a crucial issue in environments shared by multiple
organizations.</p>
