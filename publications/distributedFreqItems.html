<h4>Abstract</h4>

<p>
We consider the problem of maintaining frequency counts for items
occurring frequently in the union of multiple distributed data
streams. Naive methods of combining approximate frequency counts from
multiple nodes tend to result in excessively large data structures
that are costly to transfer among nodes. To minimize communication
requirements, the degree of precision maintained by each node while
counting item frequencies must be managed carefully. We introduce the
concept of a <i>precision gradient</i> for managing precision when
nodes are arranged in a hierarchical communication structure. We then
study the optimization problem of how to set the precision gradient so
as to minimize communication, and provide optimal solutions that
minimize worst-case communication load over all possible inputs. We
then introduce a variant designed to perform well in practice, with
input data that does not conform to worst-case characteristics. We
verify the effectiveness of our approach empirically using real-world
data, and show that our methods incur substantially less communication
than naive approaches while providing the same error guarantees on
answers.  
</p><p> 
In addition, we extend techniques for maintaining
frequency counts of high-frequency items in one or more streams by
making them time-sensitive. Time-sensitivity is achieved by
associating weights with items that decay exponentially with time. We
analyze the error bounds and worst-case space bounds for the extended
algorithms.
