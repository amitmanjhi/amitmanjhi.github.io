<h4>Abstract</h4>
A promising approach to scaling Web applications is to distribute the server
infrastructure on which they run. This approach, unfortunately, can introduce
latency between the application and database servers, which in turn increases
the network latency of Web interactions for the clients (end users). In this
paper we introduce the concept of source-to-source holistic
transformations---transformations that seek to optimize both the application
code and the database requests made by it, to reduce client latency. As
examples of our concept, we propose and evaluate two source-to-source holistic
transformations that focus on hiding the latencies of database queries. We
argue that opportunities for applying these transformations will continue to
exist in Web applications.  We then present algorithms for automating these
transformations in a source-to-source compiler.  Finally, we evaluate the
effect of these two transformations on three realistic Web benchmark
applications, both in the traditional centralized setting and a distributed
setting.
