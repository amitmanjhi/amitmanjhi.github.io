<h4>Abstract</h4>

<p>For Web applications in which the database component is the
bottleneck, scalability can be provided by a third-party <em> Database
Scalability Service Provider (DSSP)</em> that caches application data
and supplies query answers on behalf of the application.
Cost-effective DSSPs will need to cache data from many applications,
inevitably raising concerns about security. However, if all data
passing through a DSSP is encrypted to enhance security, then data
updates trigger invalidation of large regions of cache. Consequently,
achieving good scalability becomes virtually impossible. There is a
tradeoff between security and scalability, which requires careful
consideration. </p>

<p>
In this paper we study the security-scalability tradeoff, both
formally and empirically.  We begin by providing a method for
statically identifying segments of the database that can be encrypted
without impacting scalability. Experiments over a prototype DSSP
system show the effectiveness of our static analysis method---for all
three realistic benchmark applications that we study, our method
enables a significant fraction of the database to be encrypted without
impacting scalability.  Moreover, most of the data that can be
encrypted without impacting scalability is of the type that
application designers will want to encrypt, all other things being
equal.  Based on our static analysis method, we propose a new
scalability-conscious security design methodology that features: (a)
compulsory encryption of highly sensitive data like credit card
information, and (b) encryption of data for which encryption does not
impair scalability. As a result, the security-scalability tradeoff
needs to be considered only over data for which encryption impacts
scalability, thus greatly simplifying the task of managing the
tradeoff.</p>
