<h4>Abstract</h4>

<p>
Existing energy-efficient approaches to in-network aggregation in
sensor networks can be classified into two categories, tree-based and
multi-path-based, with each having unique strengths and weaknesses. In
this paper, we introduce Tributary-Delta, a novel approach that
combines the advantages of the tree and multi-path approaches by
running them simultaneously in different regions of the network.  We
present schemes for adjusting the regions in response to changes in
network conditions, and show how many useful aggregates can be readily
computed within this new framework.  We then show how a difficult
aggregate for this context---finding frequent items---can be
efficiently computed within the framework.  To this end, we devise the
first algorithm for frequent items (and for quantiles) that provably
minimizes the worst case total communication for non-regular trees.
In addition, we give a multi-path algorithm for frequent items that is
considerably more accurate than previous approaches.  These algorithms
form the basis for our efficient Tributary-Delta frequent items
algorithm.  Through extensive simulation with real-world and synthetic
data, we show the significant advantages of our techniques.  For
example, in computing Count under realistic loss rates, our techniques
reduce answer error by up to a factor of 3 compared to any previous
technique.
