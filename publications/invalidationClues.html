<h4>Abstract</h4>

<p>
For their scalability needs, data-intensive Web applications can use a
Database Scalability Service (DBSS), which caches applications' query
results and answers queries on their behalf. To address security/privacy 
concerns while
retaining the scalability benefits of a DBSS, applications would like
to encrypt all their cached query results yet somehow enable the DBSS
to invalidate these results when data updates render them
obsolete. Without adequate information the DBSS is forced to
invalidate large regions of its cache on an update.
In this paper, we present {\em
invalidation clues}, a general technique that enables applications to
reveal little data to the DBSS, yet limit the number of unnecessary
invalidations.  Compared with previous approaches, invalidation clues
provide applications significantly improved tradeoffs between security/privacy and
scalability.
Our experiments
using three Web application benchmarks, on a prototype DBSS we have
built, confirm that invalidation clues are indeed a low-overhead,
effective, and general technique for applications to balance
their privacy and scalability needs.
