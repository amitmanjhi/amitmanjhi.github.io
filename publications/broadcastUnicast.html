<h4>Abstract</h4>

<p>
Satellite operators have recently begun offering Internet
access over their networks. Typically, users connect to the network
using a modem for uplink, and a satellite dish for downlink. We
investigate how the performance of these networks might be improved by
two simple techniques: caching and use of the return path on the modem
link.  We examine the problem from a theoretical perspective and via
simulation. We show that the general problem is NP-Hard, as are
several special cases, and we give approximation algorithms for
them. We then use insights from these cases to design practical
heuristic schedulers which leverage caching and the modem
downlinks. Via simulation, we show that caching alone can
simultaneously reduce bandwidth requirements by 33% and improve
response times by 62%. We further show that the proposed schedulers,
combined with caching, yield a system that performs far better under
high loads than existing systems.
